# biostride-schema 

BioStride is a comprehensive schema for representing multimodal structural biology imaging data, 
from atomic-resolution structures to tissue-level organization. It supports diverse experimental 
techniques including cryo-EM, X-ray crystallography, SAXS/SANS, fluorescence microscopy, and 
spectroscopic imaging.

## Schema Organization

The schema follows a hierarchical structure that mirrors how structural biology research is organized:

The top-level entity is a [Dataset](Dataset.md), which serves as a container for related research.
A dataset might represent all data from a specific grant, collaboration, or publication.

Each dataset contains one or more [Studies](Study.md), which are focused investigations of specific
biological questions. For example, a study might investigate "Heat stress response in Arabidopsis"
or "Structure of the human ribosome under different conditions."

Within each study, you'll find:

### Biological Materials
- [Samples](Sample.md): The biological specimens being studied (proteins, nucleic acids, complexes, 
  cells, tissues). Each sample includes detailed molecular composition, buffer conditions, and 
  storage information. For example, a purified protein with its sequence, concentration, and buffer pH.

- [Sample Preparations](SamplePreparation.md): How samples were prepared for specific techniques.
  This includes cryo-EM grid preparation (vitrification parameters), crystallization conditions for
  X-ray studies, or staining protocols for fluorescence microscopy.

### Data Collection
- [Instruments](Instrument.md): The equipment used, from Titan Krios microscopes to synchrotron 
  beamlines. Each instrument type ([CryoEMInstrument](CryoEMInstrument.md), 
  [XRayInstrument](XRayInstrument.md), [SAXSInstrument](SAXSInstrument.md)) has specific parameters
  like accelerating voltage, detector type, or beam energy.

- [Experiment Runs](ExperimentRun.md): Individual data collection sessions that link samples to 
  instruments. An experiment run captures when, how, and under what conditions data was collected,
  including quality metrics like resolution and completeness.

### Data Processing
- [Workflow Runs](WorkflowRun.md): Computational processing steps applied to raw data. This includes
  motion correction for cryo-EM movies, 3D reconstruction, model building, or phase determination
  for crystallography. Each workflow tracks the software used, parameters, and computational resources.

### Data Products
- [Data Files](DataFile.md): Any files generated or used, from raw data to final models. Each file
  is tracked with checksums for data integrity and typed (micrograph, particles, volume, model).

- [Images](Image.md): Specialized classes for different imaging modalities:
  - [Image2D](Image2D.md): Micrographs, diffraction patterns
  - [Image3D](Image3D.md): 3D reconstructions, tomograms
  - [FTIRImage](FTIRImage.md): Molecular composition maps from infrared spectroscopy
  - [FluorescenceImage](FluorescenceImage.md): Fluorophore-labeled cellular components
  - [OpticalImage](OpticalImage.md): Brightfield/phase contrast microscopy
  - [XRFImage](XRFImage.md): Elemental distribution maps

## Example Usage

A typical cryo-EM study of a protein complex would include:
1. Sample records for the purified complex with molecular weight and buffer composition
2. Grid preparation details with vitrification parameters
3. Microscope specifications and data collection parameters
4. Processing workflows from motion correction through 3D refinement
5. Final reconstructed volumes and fitted atomic models

A multimodal plant imaging study might combine:
1. Whole plant optical imaging for morphology
2. XRF imaging to map nutrient distribution
3. FTIR spectroscopy to identify stress-related molecular changes
4. Fluorescence microscopy to track specific protein responses
5. Cryo-EM of isolated organelles for ultrastructural details

## Usage Guidelines

**Identifiers:**
- Use globally unique URIs (e.g., `biostride:sample_tfiid_001`) for `id` fields to enable cross-dataset linking and semantic web integration.
- Use `code` fields (e.g., `sample_code`, `instrument_code`, `experiment_code`) for human-friendly lab or facility references.

**Date Formats:**
- All date and datetime fields are strings. Use ISO 8601 format (e.g., `2024-03-20` or `2024-03-20T10:00:00`) for consistency.

**Units:**
- Numeric fields specify units in their descriptions (e.g., molecular_weight in kDa, temperature in Celsius, concentration in mg/mL or ÂµM).
- Always check the field description for the required unit and ensure data is provided accordingly.

**Best Practices:**
- Inline collections (e.g., `samples`, `instrument_runs`) as lists within their parent objects.
- Include all required fields, even in minimal examples.
- Use enum values as specified in the schema for controlled vocabularies.
- Reference related entities by their `id` (e.g., `sample_id`, `instrument_id`).

## FAQ & Troubleshooting

**Q: How do I reference entities across the schema?**
A: Use the globally unique `id` of the target entity (e.g., set `sample_id` in an ExperimentRun to the `id` of a Sample).

**Q: When should I use an `id` vs a `code` field?**
A: Use `id` for machine-readable, globally unique identifiers (URIs or CURIEs). Use `code` for human-friendly, local/lab tracking.

**Q: What date format should I use?**
A: Always use ISO 8601 strings (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS`).

**Q: How do I handle technique-specific metadata?**
A: Use the appropriate subclass (e.g., CryoEMInstrument, XRayInstrument) and fill in all required and relevant technique-specific fields. Refer to the schema and examples for guidance.

**Q: Where can I find more examples?**
A: See the [tests/data/valid](../tests/data/valid/) directory for many complete YAML examples covering all major schema classes.
