title: "Design of pseudosymmetric protein hetero-oligomers"
description: |
  Systematic computational design and experimental validation of pseudosymmetric 
  protein hetero-oligomers with three or more unique subunits. The study combines 
  divide-and-conquer design strategy with comprehensive structural characterization 
  using SAXS, negative-stain EM, and native mass spectrometry.
